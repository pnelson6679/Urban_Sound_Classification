# Urban_Sound_Classification
This is dedicated to solving Analytics Vidhya's Urban Sound Classification problem.

## Problem Statement from the [website](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-urban-sound-classification/#ProblemStatement)
When you start your machine learning journey, you go with simple machine learning problems like titanic survival prediction or digit recogntion. But you still don't have enough practice when it comes to real life problems. To give you a taste of one such problem, we present you "Urban Sound Classification". This practice problem is meant to introduce you to audio processing in the usual classification scenario.
### Data
This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music.


The attributes of data are as follows:

ID – Unique ID of sound excerpt

Class – type of sound

The evaluation metric for this problem is "Accuracy Score"
